## Base URL and reverse-proxy prefix

- Default base URL (local): `http://localhost:5000`
- If served behind NGINX under a prefix (e.g., `/coar`), prepend that prefix to all paths (e.g.,
  `/coar/api/software/status`, `/coar/health`).

## Authentication

Some endpoints require an API token sent via the `x-api-key` header. The token is configured through the
`API_TOKEN` environment variable (loaded from `.env`, like all other configuration — see `.env.example`).

Set it before running the app:

```sh
# in your .env
API_TOKEN=<your-strong-token>
```

Generate a strong value with:

```sh
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Clients then send that value in the `x-api-key` header. Requests with a missing or incorrect token receive
`401 Unauthorized`.

Example header:

```
x-api-key: <your-token>
```

## Health Endpoints

### Service Health

- **GET `/health`**
    - Returns service status and basic ArangoDB info
    - Returns 200 when up; 503 when down

Example:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:5000/health | jq
```

### General Status (with auth)

- **GET `/status`**
    - Headers: `x-api-key`
    - Checks API access and database reachability; lists existence of key collections

Example:

```sh
curl -s -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" http://localhost:5000/status | jq
```

## Document Management

### Documents Collection Status

- **GET `/api/documents`**
    - Returns count and status of documents collection

### Latest Documents

- **GET `/api/documents/latest`**
    - Returns the most recently ingested documents, newest first
    - Query Parameters:
        - `limit`: Number of documents to return (1-100, default: 10)
    - Sorted by ingestion time (`created_at`); documents ingested before this
      field was introduced are not included
    - Response: `{ "count", "limit", "documents": [{ "file_hal_id", "created_at" }] }`

### Get Document by ID

- **GET `/api/document/<id>`**
    - Returns document metadata by HAL identifier
    - Returns 404 if not found

### Delete Document

- **DELETE `/api/document/<id>`**
    - Headers: `x-api-key`
    - Deletes a document and ALL its associated software mentions
    - Performs atomic deletion: edges → software → document
    - Returns JSON response with deletion statistics
    - Returns 404 if document not found
    - Returns 500 if deletion fails

Response examples:

```json
# Success (200)
{
  "status": "deleted",
  "document_id": "hal-01478788",
  "software_deleted": 5
}

# Document not found (404)
{
  "error": "Document not found"
}

# Deletion failed (500)
{
  "error": "Failed to delete document"
}
```

### Get Document Software (All)

- **GET `/api/document/<id_document>/software`**
    - Returns all software mentions for a specific document

### Get Document Software (Specific)

- **GET `/api/document/<id_document>/software/<id_software>`**
    - Returns a specific software mention for a document

### Insert Document

- **POST `/api/document`**

    - Content-Type: `multipart/form-data` with fields:
        - `file`: JSON file containing software metadata (required)
        - `document_id`: HAL identifier for the document (required)
        - `notify`: whether to send notifications after ingestion (optional, default `true`). Set to `false` (also accepts `0`, `no`, `off`) to load the data without sending any notification — useful for bulk imports.
    - Returns 201 on new insert, 409 if already exists
    - When `notify` is enabled (default), triggers a notification send attempt to HAL and Software Heritage; when disabled the response contains `"notifications": {"skipped": true}`

## Mention Quality Filter API

The Mention Quality Filter scores every software-mention name and flags low-quality / junk ones (see
[Mention Quality Filter](mention-quality-filter.md)). Like the blacklist it **flags, doesn't drop**, and is
**enforced only at notification time** (and only while `MENTION_QUALITY_FILTER_ENABLED` is on). The `/mention-quality`
web UI (linked from the dashboard) shows the current counts and a button to re-run the filter; it is backed
by two endpoints:

- **GET `/api/mention-quality/stats`**
    - Read-only counts: `total_mentions`, `scored`, `quality_invalid`, `distinct_names`, plus the active
      `threshold` and whether enforcement is `enabled`. Does not modify data.
- **POST `/api/mention-quality/reapply`**
    - Re-scores every stored mention with the current model and rewrites `quality_score` / `quality_invalid`
      at `MENTION_QUALITY_FILTER_THRESHOLD` (default 0.4). Use it to backfill mentions ingested before the filter
      existed, or to propagate a retrained model. Idempotent for a fixed model+threshold; a logged no-op
      if the model file is unavailable. Returns `{ "status", "updated", "quality_invalid", "distinct_scored" }`.

To inspect *which* mentions are flagged, use the `/api/software/latest` filters above
(`?quality_invalid=true`, `?blacklisted=true`).

```sh
# Current Mention Quality Filter counts
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/mention-quality/stats | jq

# Re-score all stored mentions (backfill / after retraining)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mention-quality/reapply | jq
```

## Blacklist Management

The blacklist holds generic or non-software terms (e.g. `Python`, `Windows`, `Section`) that should not
generate notifications. Its behaviour:

- **Flag, don't drop.** At ingestion every mention is stored; mentions whose normalized name is on the
  blacklist are marked `blacklisted: true` on the `software` document. Nothing is silently discarded.
- **Enforced only at notification time.** When notifications are built, blacklisted mentions are excluded
  from what is sent to HAL and Software Heritage (the rest of the data, and the APIs, still expose them).
- **Persistent storage.** The blacklist lives in the ArangoDB `blacklist` collection, so edits made through
  the API or UI survive restarts. On first startup it is seeded once from `app/static/data/blacklist.csv`.
- **Web UI.** A management page is available at `/blacklist` (add/remove/filter terms, a read-only
  *Count matches* dry run, *Reapply*, and CSV export).

> **Note on auth:** the blacklist write endpoints below (`POST`/`DELETE`/`reapply`/`reload`/`import`) are
> **not** behind `x-api-key` — they back the unauthenticated `/blacklist` UI. Gate them at the reverse proxy
> if the UI must be restricted.

Because enforcement uses the stored flag, changing the blacklist does **not** retroactively change already
ingested documents — run **Reapply** (`POST /api/blacklist/reapply`) to recompute flags across stored mentions.

### View Blacklist

- **GET `/api/blacklist`**
    - Query Parameters:
        - `search`: Search terms (optional)
        - `limit`: Maximum number of results (default: 50)
    - Returns blacklist terms with statistics

### Get Blacklist Statistics

- **GET `/api/blacklist/stats`**
    - Returns statistics about the blacklist (total terms, storage backend, seed path)

### Count Matches (dry run)

- **GET `/api/blacklist/match-count`**
    - Read-only: counts how many **stored** mentions the current blacklist would flag, without changing
      anything. Returns `total_mentions`, `matching_mentions`, `matching_names`, and `blacklist_terms`.
    - Useful to size up the impact before running Reapply.

### Add Term to Blacklist

- **POST `/api/blacklist`**
    - JSON Body: `{"term": "term_to_add"}`
    - Returns 201 on success, 409 if term already exists

### Remove Term from Blacklist

- **DELETE `/api/blacklist/<term>`**
    - Returns 200 on success, 404 if term not found
    - The term is taken as a URL path segment (a `path` converter, so names containing `/` are supported);
      percent-encode it in the client.

### Reapply Blacklist to Existing Documents

- **POST `/api/blacklist/reapply`**
    - Recomputes the `blacklisted` flag on **every** stored mention against the current blacklist (sets
      `true` for listed names, `false` otherwise — also backfilling mentions ingested before the flag existed).
    - Returns `{"status": "reapplied", "updated": N, "blacklisted": M}`.
    - This is a single AQL `UPDATE` over the whole `software` collection; on large datasets it can take a while.

### Reload Blacklist from the Seed CSV

- **POST `/api/blacklist/reload`**
    - Merges the seed CSV (`app/static/data/blacklist.csv`) into the collection, adding any missing terms
      (existing terms are left untouched). Returns the total term count.

### Export Blacklist

- **GET `/api/blacklist/export`**
    - Downloads the blacklist as a CSV file

### Import Blacklist

- **POST `/api/blacklist/import`**
    - Form Data:
        - `file`: CSV file to import (required)
        - `overwrite`: Whether to clear the collection before importing (default: false)
    - Returns import results with statistics

Examples:

```sh
# View blacklist
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/blacklist | jq

# Search blacklist terms
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/blacklist?search=python&limit=10" | jq

# Get statistics

# Count how many stored mentions the current blacklist would flag (read-only)
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/blacklist/match-count | jq

# Add term
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"term": "example"}' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/blacklist | jq

# Remove term (percent-encode names containing "/")
curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/blacklist/example | jq

# Recompute the blacklisted flag on all stored mentions
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/blacklist/reapply | jq

# Merge the seed CSV into the collection
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/blacklist/reload | jq

# Export blacklist
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/blacklist/export -o blacklist.csv
```

## COAR Notify Inbox

The COAR Notify inbox handles bidirectional communication for software mention verification workflows.

### Get Inbox Documentation

- **GET `/inbox`**
    - Returns comprehensive API documentation for the COAR Notify inbox
    - Includes request/response examples, supported notification types, and usage instructions

    - Returns 202 with notification processing summary
    - Automatically updates verification status in database
    - **Every** received notification is persisted to the `received_notifications`
      collection (with a `received_at` timestamp and a classified `origin` of
      `swh`, `hal`, or `unknown`), including those that are ignored.
    - Notifications originating from Software Heritage are stored but **not
      dispatched** (returned with `"status": "ignored"`), to avoid notification
      loops.

### View Received Notifications

- **GET `/notifications`**

    - Query params:
        - `limit` — max records to return (1–1000, default 100)
        - `origin` — optional filter, `swh` or `hal` (any other value → 400)
    - Response: `{ "count": <n>, "origin": <filter|null>, "notifications": [ ... ] }`
    - Each record: `{ "_key", "received_at", "origin", "payload": { ...verbatim notification... } }`

### Get a Received Notification by Key (JSON)

- **GET `/api/notifications/<key>`** — requires `x-api-key`
    - `<key>` is the `_key` returned by the list endpoint
    - Returns the single record, or 404 if not found
